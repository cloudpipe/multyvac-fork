        Multyvac
        ========
        
        Multyvac gives Python developers a simple interface for offloading
        computational workloads to the cloud.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        You need to set an Api Key for your machine. To do this, run the following from your shell:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ python -m multyvac.setup
           
        Follow the on screen instructions to complete the setup process.
        
        Verify Installation
        ---------------------
        
        Open up Python, and import multyvac:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           >>> import multyvac
        
        If you get an ImportError, something went wrong. Try running the setup again.
        
        Running a Job
        =============
        
        The idea is to take a function that you would normally run on your own machine, but instead run it on Multyvac. Here's an example of how you would offload a function for adding two numbers:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           >>> def add(x, y):
           ...     return x + y
           >>> # run add on your machine
           >>> add(1, 2)
           3
           >>> # submit add to Multyvac
           >>> job_id = multyvac.submit(add, 1, 2)
           >>> # get job object
           >>> job = multyvac.get(job_id)
           >>> # wait for job to finish processing
           >>> job.wait()
           >>> # verify the result is the same
           >>> job.result
